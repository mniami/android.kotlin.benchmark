# Introduction
This is my very first Android application written in Kotlin. 
At the very first I would like to learn Kotlin and the second is to write some volunteers help application.

# Purpose

1. Learning Kotlin in Android
2. Write some volunteers manage application to keep all information in one Android App place

# Technologies

**Kotlin** I'm using Kotlin as a main language.

**Material Design** Trying to use Material Design in some places, ultimately I would like to have all app layouts written using Material Design standard.

**Firebase Database** Using Firebase database I can easily manage incoming data.

**Firebase authentication** Using Firebase authentication I can easily create accounts for the user and authenticate them without creating custom server.
